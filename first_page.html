        <b>Pizza</b> dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped </br> with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, </br> and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired </br> oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
    <p> One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped </br> with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named </br> for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour </br>and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the <i>Italian flag</i>.</br>

        Boiled crawfish is a popular Cajun dish.
